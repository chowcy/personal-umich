				<div class="text">
					<p>	Hello there! I am currently a senior at the University of Michigan and 
						will be graduating in May with a Bachelor of Science in German. I know 
						- it's kind of a weird degree to have since most German majors get a 
						Bachelor of Arts, but I love science too much to not get a degree in it! 
						My philosophy during my four years at U of M has always been to learn as 
						much as possible. As a result, I have taken courses or attended workshops 
						in a variety of different fields. My intellectual pursuits include biology, 
						mathematics, public health, foreign languages and translation, education, 
						psychology, nutritional science, statistics, and more recently, programming! 
						Right now I'm teaching myself some basic web development and this website 
						is a little independent project I'm working on :)
					</p>
					<p>In late August, I will be heading to Germany to teach English to German 
						students for 10 months as part of the Fulbright English Teaching 
						Assistantship Grant Program. I am currently looking for an internship or 
						job for the summer of 2015 in Ann Arbor. Fields: programming, translation, 
						or teaching, but in all honesty, I would be happy to work for any employer 
						that will utilize my skillset, challenge me, and treat both its employees 
						and customers with the respect they deserve, regardless of the field.
					</p>

				<h3>Student Coordinator / Food Service Worker</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p><em>East Quad Dining Hall / South Quad Dining Hall</em></p>
						<p>
							This was my first job ever. I have been working here since my freshman year in college, 
							and although some people find food service to be a degrading job, I do not. Working with 
							food is fun! And so is working with people who love food. After South Quad closed for 
							renovations, I moved to East Quad and became a student coordinator there. I train student 
							workers, and communicate with managers to ensure a smooth and pleasant meal.

				<h3>Webmaster and Historian</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p><em>German Club at the University of Michigan</em></p>
						<p>
							I've been involved in German Club since my junior year and went on to become an executive 
							board position as Webmaster and Historian. As Historian, I take a bunch of photos, and 
							as Webmaster, I post these photos on our Facebook page and write weekly updates. Check 
							out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/germanclubumich" target="blank">Facebook page</a>!

				<h3>EECS 183 Grader</h3>

				<h3>Teacher's Assistant</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p><em>Deutsche Schule Ann Arbor</em></p>
						<p>
							I helped the teacher of the Kindergarten class "teach" German to her pupils. 
							I say "teach" but it's more like "attemped to teach." Kids will learn what they want 
							to learn.

				<h3>President, Secretary, Community Service Chair, Webmaster, Historian</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p><em>Secular Student Alliance at the University of Michigan</em></p>
						<p>
							I've had a billion roles as part of this organization. I've organized events, 
							sent emails, managed their Facebook, Twitter, and Blogger accounts, taken 
							photos, tabled for them. All in the name of science, reason, and secular values!
						</p>

				<h3>Intern</h3>
					<div class="text">
						<p><em>Charit&eacute; Universit&auml;tsmedizin Berlin</em></p>
						<p>
							As a Cultural Vistas Fellow in the Summer of 2014, I got to live and intern in Berlin 
							for free! I worked at a hospital, shadowing nutritional therapists, social workers,
							and doctors in the adiposity and gastroenterological Kinderklinik (children's clinic) 
							of the Charit&eacute;, as well as training personnel on SPSS and creating a database 
							for an exciting upcoming study aiming to improve fatty liver disease diagnosis.
